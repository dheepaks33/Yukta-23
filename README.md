# Yukta-23

**Inspiration**: During our ML workshop, which saw enthusiastic participation from around Tamil Nadu, held on March 20th at PSG iTech, Coimbatore, my team and I were inspired to create a simple yet powerful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This model is designed to identify whether a given image features a dog or a cat. This project embodies the joy of learning and showcases how knowledge gained during the workshop can be applied to real-world tasks. It demonstrates our commitment to practical, hands-on learning experiences and the application of machine learning concepts to solve everyday problems.

# DogCatClassifier

  DogCatClassifier is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to perform image classification, specifically distinguishing between images that contain dogs and images that contain cats. This deep learning model has been trained on a dataset of labeled dog and cat images, allowing it to make accurate predictions when presented with new and unseen images. It utilizes the power of neural networks and convolutional layers to automatically learn and extract relevant features from images, making it a valuable tool for tasks involving pet image recognition and classification.
